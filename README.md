# Tutte_polynomial
The code contains a structured explanation of the python computation of Tutte Polynomial in graphs. 
A ‘MultiGraph’ class is introduced with numerous functions and properties, that allows loops and 
parallel edges in a graph. Furthermore, the code describes individual points of the polynomial 
and checks whether they coincide with the graph properties. It provides a list of solved examples.
